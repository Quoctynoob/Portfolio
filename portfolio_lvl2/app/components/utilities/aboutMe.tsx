                <h1>About Me.</h1>
                <p>
                I'm a computer science student at the University of Guelph with a strong passion for full-stack 
                development, particularly enjoying back-end work. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid 
                foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. I've worked on several 
                projects, including developing web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and HTML/CSS. 
                Currently, I'm working on an exciting game project using Java, which has allowed me to deepen my 
                understanding of object-oriented programming and game design.
                Outside of academics and coding, I'm an avid tennis player and enjoy other racket sports as well, which 
                keep me active and disciplined. I also love watching anime, which has sparked my interest in Japanese 
                culture and led me to start learning the language.
                I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity 
                that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
